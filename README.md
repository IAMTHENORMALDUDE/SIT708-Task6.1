# Personalized Learning Experience App

## Overview
This Android application provides personalized learning experiences, adaptive assessments, and intelligent tutoring based on student interests. The app integrates with a backend API that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate quiz questions tailored to the user's selected topics of interest.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration system with secure password handling
- **Interest Selection**: Users can select up to 10 topics of interest during account setup
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Displays tasks generated based on user interests
- **Adaptive Quizzes**: Each task includes a quiz with questions generated by an LLM based on the topic
- **Results Tracking**: Shows quiz results and tracks user progress
- **Local Database**: Stores user information, interests, and task completion status

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Android (Java) with Room Database for local storage
- **Backend**: Python Flask API with Hugging Face LLM integration
- **Network**: Volley for API communication

### Components
1. **User Management**:
   - Room Database for storing user credentials and preferences
   - SessionManager for handling login state

2. **Interest Management**:
   - Selection UI with toggleable buttons
   - Database storage of user interests

3. **Task Generation**:
   - Tasks are created based on user interests
   - Stored locally for offline access

4. **Quiz System**:
   - Questions generated via backend LLM API
   - Multiple-choice format with answer validation
   - Results display and feedback

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `BackendApiLLM` directory
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install flask requests python-dotenv`
5. Create a `.env` file with your Hugging Face API token: `HF_API_TOKEN=your_token_here`
6. Run the server: `python main.py`

### Android App Setup
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device
3. For emulator testing, the backend API is configured to connect to `10.0.2.2:4000`
4. For physical device testing, update the `BASE_URL` in `ApiClient.java` to your computer's IP address

## Project Structure
- `models/`: Data models and Room Database components
- `utils/`: Utility classes for API communication and session management
- `adapters/`: RecyclerView adapters
- Activities for each screen in the application flow

## Future Enhancements
- Add more personalization options
- Implement advanced analytics for learning progress
- Add support for different question types
- Enhance UI with animations and transitions
